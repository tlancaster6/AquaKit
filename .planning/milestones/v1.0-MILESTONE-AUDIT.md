### Phase 5 Details

- **Plan 05-01** (basedpyright standard + CI fix): Completed. SUMMARY exists.
- **Plan 05-02** (GitHub repo config): Completed by user (human-action checkpoint).
- **Plan 05-03** (Rewiring guide): Completed. SUMMARY exists.

### Phase 6 Details (Gap Closure)

Resolved 3 tech debt items from original audit:
- README now documents PyTorch as prerequisite
- `back_project` now delegates to `snells_law_3d` (no inline copy)
- Empty `tests/e2e/` and `tests/integration/` directories removed

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Status: CLEAN (34/34 connections verified)**

| Connection | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Phase 2 → Phase 1 (projection/refractive.py imports refraction.py, types.py) | Wired |
| Phase 2 → Phase 1 (refractive.py imports snells_law_3d — Phase 6 dedup) | Wired |
| Phase 3 → Phase 1 (calibration.py imports CameraIntrinsics, CameraExtrinsics, InterfaceParams) | Wired |
| Phase 3 → Phase 3 (undistortion.py imports CameraData from calibration.py) | Wired |
| Phase 4 independence (io/ has no calibration imports — clean isolation) | Verified |
| Phase 5 → All (CI test suite covers 226 tests across all phases) | Wired |
| All phases → __init__.py (34 public symbols in __all__, all resolving) | Verified |

No orphaned exports. No missing connections. No broken import chains.

---

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Load calibration → create camera → project → triangulate | Complete | test_refractive_triangulation_integration exercises full chain |
| Load calibration → compute undistortion maps → undistort image | Complete | test_roundtrip_pinhole and test_roundtrip_fisheye |
| Create frameset → iterate frames | Complete | test_imageset_iter_all_frames, test_imageset_context_manager |
| Import everything from aquakit top-level | Complete | 34 symbols in __all__, all importable |

---

## Remaining Tech Debt

| Item | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| torch not in pyproject.toml dependencies | Low | Intentional (platform-specific). README now documents this. |

### Resolved by Phase 6

| Item | Resolution |
|------|------------|
| README missing PyTorch install note | Added to Development section |
| Inline Snell's law copy in back_project | Replaced with snells_law_3d call |
| Empty tests/e2e/ and tests/integration/ dirs | Removed |

---

## Human Verification Items (from phase reports)

| Item | Phase | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| CUDA device test execution | 1 | Pending — requires CUDA hardware |
| Round-trip tolerance interpretation (radians vs pixels) | 1 | Acknowledged — physics is correct |
| Frame-exact sync with real recorded footage | 4 | Pending — requires real multi-camera video |
| Resource cleanup under OS handle limits (16+ cameras) | 4 | Pending — requires scale testing |

These are environment-dependent validations that cannot be automated in the current CI setup. None are blockers for v1.0 release.
